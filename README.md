# What is AWS Textract service :

Textract is a machine learning service that automatically extracts text, handwriting, and data from scanned documents that goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to identify and extract data from forms and tables. Today, many companies manually extract data from scanned documents like PDFs, images, tables, and forms, or through simple OCR software that requires manual configuration which oftentimes requires reconfiguration when the form changes. To overcome these manual and expensive processes, Textract uses machine learning to read and process any type of document, accurately extracting text, handwriting, tables and other data without any manual effort
